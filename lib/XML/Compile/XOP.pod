=head1 NAME

XML::Compile::XOP - MTOM and XOP handler

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # by default, XML::Compile encodes binary data
  my $answer    = $call->(image => $binary_image);

  # to enable use of MTOM
  use XML::Compile::XOP;
  my $xop       = XML::Compile::XOP->new;
  my $xop_image = $xop->bytes($binary_image);
  my $answer    = $call->(image => $xop_image);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The SOAP Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism (MTOM) is designed
for SOAP1.2, but also usable for SOAP1.1.  It optimizes the transport of
binary information (like images) which are part of the XML message: in
stead of base64 encoding them adding 25% to the size of the data, these
binaries are added as pure binary attachement to the SOAP message.

In the official specification, the XML message will be created first
with the base64 representation of the data in it.  Only at transmission,
a preprocessor XOP (XML-binary Optimized Packaging) extracts those
components to be send seperately.  In Perl, we have to be more careful
about performance.  Therefore, the path via encoding to base64 and then
decoding it back to binary in the sender (and the reverse process for
the receiver) is avoided.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructors

$obj-E<gt>B<bytes>((STRING|SCALAR), OPTIONS)

=over 4

Create a L<XML::Compile::XOP::Include|XML::Compile::XOP::Include> object which sources from a
STRING (representing bytes) or a SCALAR reference to such a string.
With the OPTIONS, you can overrule defaults generated for the "Include"
object.

example: use of bytes()

  my $data = $xop->bytes($string, type => 'text/html');
  # $data is a XML::Compile::XOP::Include

=back

$obj-E<gt>B<file>((FILENAME|FILEHANDLE), OPTIONS)

=over 4

Create a L<XML::Compile::XOP::Include|XML::Compile::XOP::Include> object which sources from a
FILE specified by NAME or HANDLE.  With the OPTIONS, you can overrule
defaults generated for the "Include" object.

example: use of file()

  use MIME::Types;
  my $mimetypes = MIME::Types->new;

  my $type = $mimetypes->mimeTypeOf($fn);
  my $data = $xop->file($fn, type => $fn);
  # $data is a XML::Compile::XOP::Include

=back

XML::Compile::XOP-E<gt>B<new>(OPTIONS)

=over 4

 Option         --Default
 hostname         'localhost'
 xmlmime_version  XMIME11
 xop_version      XOP10

. hostname => STRING

=over 4

This is used as part of generated Content-IDs, which have the form of
a email address.

=back

. xmlmime_version => URI

. xop_version => URI
