=head1 NAME

XML::Compile::SOAP::Trace - help displaying trace details.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my ($answer, $trace) = $call->(%params);
 #now $trace is a XML::Compile::SOAP::Trace

 my $req = $trace->request;   # HTTP message which was sent
 my $res = $trace->response;  # HTTP message received

 my $start = $trace->date;
 my $dura  = $trace->elapse;

 $trace->printTimings;
 $trace->printTimings(\*STDERR);
 $trace->printRequest;
 $trace->printResponse;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This help module simplifies user access to the trace data,
as produced by a SOAP call (client side).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructors

=over 4

=item XML::Compile::SOAP::Trace-E<gt>B<new>(OPTIONS)

Called by the SOAP call implementation; not for normal users.

=head2 Accessors

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<date>

Returns the date string which represent the moment that the call
was initiated.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<elapse>([KIND])

Returns the time in seconds (with hires, sub-second detail) of a part of
the SOAP communication. Some values may be C<undef>.  Elapse without
argument will return the total time elapsed.

As KINDs are defined C<encode> (the time required by the translator
build by XML::Compile::Schema to translate Perl into an XML::LibXML
tree), C<transport>, and C<decode> (from XML::LibXML tree into Perl)>.
The transport components are also provided seperately, as C<stringify>
(by XML::LibXML to convert a tree into text), C<connect> (for the network
message exchange by HTTP::Daemon), and C<parse> (parsing answer string
into XML)

See L<printTimings()|XML::Compile::SOAP::Trace/"Printing">.

example: 

 print $trace->elapse('decode');

=item $obj-E<gt>B<error>

Often contains an error message, when something went wrong.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<request>

Returns the HTTP::Request object used for this SOAP call.  This might
be quite useful during debugging, because a lot of the processing is
hidden for the user... but you may want to see or log what is actually
begin send.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<response>

Returns the HTTP::Response object, returned by the remote server.  In
some erroneous cases, the client library will create an error response
without any message was exchanged.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<start>

Returns the (platform dependent) time value which represent the moment
that the call was initiated.  See Time::HiRes method C<time>.

=head2 Printing

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<printRequest>([FILEHANDLE])

=item $obj-E<gt>B<printResponse>([FILEHANDLE])

=item $obj-E<gt>B<printTimings>([FILEHANDLE])

Print an overview on various timings to the selected filehandle.
