=head1 NAME

XML::Compile::SOAP::Extension - plugins for standards

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module defines hooks which are used to implement the SOAP and WSDL
extensions.  Where SOAP does lack a lot of useful features, many
working-groups have added components on various spots in the XML
messages.
