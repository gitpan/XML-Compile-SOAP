=head1 METHODS

=head2 Instantiation

This object can not be instantiated, but is only used as secundary
base class.  The primary must contain the C<new>.

=head2 Debugging

$obj-E<gt>B<fakeServer>([FAKE|undef])

XML::Compile::SOAP::Client-E<gt>B<fakeServer>([FAKE|undef])

=over 4

Returns the fake server, if defined: it will be called to simulate
an external SOAP server.  Use this for debugging and regression test
scripts.

Usually, you should set your own FAKE server, but simply instantiate
a L<XML::Compile::SOAP::Tester|XML::Compile::SOAP::Tester> object.

BE WARNED: this FAKE server must be instantiated B<before> the
SOAP client handlers are compiled.
