=head1 NAME

XML::Compile::XOP::Include - Represents one XOP node.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # See also SYNOPSIS of XML::Compile::XOP
  my $xop       = XML::Compile::XOP->new;
  my $xop_image = $xop->bytes($binary_image);
  my $answer    = $call->(image => $xop_image);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Represents one data-set which will be represented as separate (binary)
object during transport.  This can only be used on data fields which
are base64Binary.

YOU SHOULD NOT instantiate this kind of objects directly, but use the
L<XML::Compile::XOP|XML::Compile::XOP> method to create them.

The object is overloaded to produce the contained data when a scalar is
required, for instance when you call functions like "length".  This means
that, hopefully, the end-user does not see much of a difference between
data which is transported inline or packaged separately.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructors

=over 4

=item XML::Compile::XOP::Include-E<gt>B<fromMime>($object)

Collect the data from a HTTP::Message object.

=item XML::Compile::XOP::Include-E<gt>B<new>(%options)

You have to specify either a C<file> or C<byte> source.  Otherwise, the
constructor will return C<undef>.

 -Option--Default
  bytes   undef
  cid     <required>
  file    undef
  type    <required>
  xmime   <required>
  xop     <required>

=over 2

=item bytes => STRING|SCALAR

Take the data from a STRING of reference.

=item cid => STRING

The Content-ID of the binary attachment.

=item file => FILENAME|FILEHANDLE

Take the data from the specified file.

=item type => MIMETYPE

The MIME-Type of the data.

=item xmime => VERSION

=item xop => VERSION

=head2 Accessors

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<cid>()

Returns the Content-ID.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<content>( [$byref] )

Returns the content, when $byref (boolean) is true, then the value is
returned by reference.

=back

=head2 Processing

=over 4

=item $obj-E<gt>B<mimePart>( [$headers] )

Produce the message part which contains a normal mime representation
of a binary file.  You may provide an initial $headers (HTTP::Headers)
object, or an ARRAY of headers to instantiate such an object.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<write>($filename|$fh)

Write the content to the specified FILE.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<xmlNode>($document, $path, $tag)

The $document will be used to construct the node from.  The $path
is an indicator for the location of the node within the data
structure (used in error messages).  The $tag is the prefixed name
for the node to be created.

Returned is an XML node to be included in the output tree.

=head1 OVERLOAD

=over 4

=item overload: B<"">

This object stringifies to its binary content.
