=== version history of XML::Compile::SOAP

version 2.05: Thu May 28 12:31:46 CEST 2009

	Fixes:

	- remove XML::Compile::SOAP::Tester, because it was not completely
	  developed.  Signaled by [Georg Oechsler]

	- use 'namespace' parameter (if available) in SOAP::RPC
	  Reported by [Daniel Ruoso]

	- rpc-literal one-way fix (hopefully).  Reported by [Daniel Ruoso]

	Improvements:

	- support MTOM and XOP in new modules XML::Compile::XOP(::Include)
	  tests in t/60xop.t

	- trace which message top-nodes are being skipped.

version 2.04: Mon Apr 13 19:01:15 CEST 2009

	Fixes:

	- RPC/literal was seriously broken.
	  Extended example by [Daniel Ruoso].

	- address operation by port-name [Georg Oechsler]

	Improvements:

	- add filters on operations(), proposed by [Georg Oechsler]

	- added to ::Operation the accessors serviceName(), portName()
	  bindingName(), portTypeName().

	- added ::WSDL11::printIndex()

	- require LWP to be at least 5.825, because Perl 5.10 comes with a
	  version which breaks on unicode [Anton Berezin]

version 2.03: Wed Mar 25 15:44:10 CET 2009

	Fixes:

	- auto-generate service block when missing and only one portType
	  and binding defined. Used by Exchange. Reported by [Anton Berezin]

	- fix wsdl11 when "parts" is used.  [Anton Berezin]

	- do not enforce an endpoint parameter.

	- do not let HTTP error codes confuse the transporter: sometimes
	  they are produced by the SOAP handler. [Gert Doering]

	Improvements:

	- namespace work-around for unqualified Fault structure in SOAP11
	  envelope was implemented twice.  Removed one.

	- accept 'server' option to compileClient, which does only replace
	  the server name in the WSDL service location string, not the
	  whole endpoint.

version 2.02: Sun Feb 15 23:24:14 CET 2009

	Changes:

	- ::Server::compileHandler() now returns a pair: contains
	  a status code as well.

	Fixes:

	- restore accidentally removed ::Server::faultValidationFailed()

	- repair handling of server processing errors.

	- add clean handling of ::Server::faultResponseInvalid()

	- reuse created Server::faultWriter()

	- required XML::Compile::Cache 0.91 [cpantesters]

	Improvements:

	- trace the returned faults

version 2.01: Thu Feb 12 09:48:17 CET 2009

	Changes:

	- require XML::Compile v1.00 for element_form_default parameter
	  rename.

	- SOAP::version not configurable, but class constant.

	Fixes:

	- crash on server errors, when throw() is called.
	  rt.cpan.org#42528 [Piotr Roszatycki]

	- do not use /bin/pwd in t/99pod.t

	- do not prefix the user's keys without explicit user request
	  via key_rewrite => 'PREFIXED'.  Requires XML::Compile 1.01

	Improvements:

	- lookup SOAP protocol via envelope namespace as well.

        - also *::Operation now shows protocol version().

	- added serverClass() and clientClass() for ::Operation.

version 2.00_01: Mon Dec 29 11:13:05 CET 2008

	************** MAJOR REWRITE!!! *******************
	. WSDL11 based on XML::Compile::Cache, with much simpler code
	  as result.
	. many classes and methods have been renamed or removed.
	. split-off SOAP12 into distribution XML::Compile::SOAP12
	. the "document" style soap interface unchanged.
	. rpc-literal is much better now, like document style
	. rpc-encoded not yet supported.
	. pluggable back-ends for message structures (SOAP1.1, SOAP1.2,..)
	  and transporters (SOAPHTTP, XMPP, ...)

	Changes:

	- Too many changes in internals to detail.

	- you have to explicitly load XML::Compile::SOAP11 yourself, to
	  have those definitions understood by the WSDL.

	Fixes:

	- fixed t/30charset.t, with double encode of utf-8.

	Improvements:

	- port to Perl pre-5.8.3, working around broken or non-existing
	  encode() [Toby Corkindale]

	- report cause on client error which is produced in LWP [Tom]

	- removed the [new in 0.78] added elementFormDefault="qualified"
	  in favor of the new XML::Compile::Schema::importDefinitions()
	  options which do the same.

	- more trace messages.

	- new examples for rpc-literal, based on Daniel Ruoso's example.

version 0.78: Fri Oct 10 15:55:39 CEST 2008

	Fixes:

	- improved understanding of top-level elements in XML::Compile 0.95
	  broke this module:
	  . some schema lack    elementFormDefault="qualified"
	    changed in soap-encoding.xsd, wsdl-soap.xsd
	  . some problems in the RPC encoder/decoder
	  . disable t/51wsdl11enc.t

	Fixes:

	- Correcting fault handling. Code and tests(!) contributed
	  by [Jamie Lentin]

version 0.75: Mon Jul 21 09:17:10 CEST 2008

	  [Jason Tang]

	Changes:

	- require XML::Compile 0.87, which renames option output_namespaces

	  t/TestTools.t

version 0.72: Wed Apr 16 13:03:26 CEST 2008

	Fixes:

	Fixes:

	- Math::BigInt with GMP caused t/14dec11.t to fail
	  [CPANTesters, Slaven Rezic]

version 0.69: Tue Apr  8 23:48:31 CEST 2008

	Fixes:

	- Trace returned on error was not transformed into an object, and
	  resulted in unwanted undefs.

	- ::Trace->printTimings() did not handle undefs well.

	- Document that SOAPHTTP::compileClient(action) is optional, not
	  required

	- ::SOAPHTTP will use LWP::UserAgent with Keep-Alive on.

	Changes:

	- require XML::Compile 0.69 -> 0.73

	- ::WSDL11::Operation canTransport() implementation was broken,
	  and therefore needed a change of behavior.  Probably invisible

	  with the same endpoint(s).

	- New method ::SOAP::messageStructure()

	- New facility method ::SOAP::importDefinitions()

	Fixes:

	- WSDL types were compiled twice.

	- problems with specifying your own transporter when creating SOAP

	- upgrade requirement XML::Compile to 0.68

	- ::Encoding::dec()  [decode RPC] tries harder.
	  with help of [Philippe B.]

	Improvements:

	- Pass information about location of type definitions to
	  XML::Compile, for debugging and tracing.

	- ::Encoding::array new option array_type

version 0.66: Thu Jan 31 09:30:18 CET 2008

	Fixes:

	- the SOAP message is a document, not an element.  This way,
	  we get the right output encoding for free.  Problem spotted
	  by [Gert Doering]

	- more encoding/decoding character-set issues.  Test script
	  in t/30charset.t

	Improvements:

	- details about client-side soap moved from ::SOAP into
	  ::SOAP::Client

	- ::SOAP::compileClient() moved to ::SOAP::Client::

	Changes:

	- various improvements in the output of Encode::decSimplify(),
	  the automatic decoded rpc-encoded messages.

	- depends on XML::Compile 0.61

	Fixes:

	- ::Encoding::_dec_typed() confused URI and prefix.

	- rpc-encoded now tests that user's constructed question has
	  a name-space.

	Improvements:

	- updated examples in example/namesservice/
	  WSDL example is now called: has_wsdl.pl

	  RPC-literal example: rpc-literal.pl
	  RPC-Encoded example: rpc-encoded.pl
	  and 4 related simplifications, named xxxx2.pl

	- added for convenience: Encoding::encAddNamespace() [without s]

version 0.63: Sat Nov 24 00:14:07 CET 2007

	Changes:

	- requires XML::Compile 0.60

	- ::Encode::typed() now uses selected schemaNS as default, so
	  simplifies the type parameter.

	  like ::typed().

	Fixes:

	- detection of operation type, where WSDL used prefixes.

	  XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP.
	  It is reworked to extend the new XML::Compile::Transport.
	  Change invisible to WSDL users, but very visible to people
	  who create their own messages.  Some of the trace records
	  changed name as well.

	- swapped arguments of ::Encoding::typed() from
	   (name, type, value) to (type, name, value);

	- WSDL11(::Operation)::prepareClient() renamed into
	  ::compileClient()

	Improvements:

	  because people often use pre-packaged modules and therefore
	  may not see the README files.

	- extended the documentation a lot.

	- implemented XML::Compile::SOAP::compileClient(), which was
	  documented but not present.

	- added transport base class XML::Compile::Transport.

	  not understood by Perl 5.5 [Slaven Rezic]

version 0.55: Wed Oct  3 22:57:24 CEST 2007
