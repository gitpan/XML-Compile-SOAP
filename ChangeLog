=== version history of XML::Compile::SOAP

version 0.63: Sat Nov 24 00:14:07 CET 2007

	Changes:

	- requires XML::Compile 0.60

	- ::Encode::typed() now uses selected schemaNS as default, so
	  simplifies the type parameter.

	- ::Encode::element() now also has the 'type' as first parameter,
	  like ::typed().

	Fixes:

	- detection of operation type, where WSDL used prefixes.

	- some improvements and changes where not listed in the changelog
	  for version 0.62

	- fixed ::Encode::typed() when value is already an element

	- WSDL11 headers parsed wrongly. [Gert Doering]

	Improvements:

	- added t/51wsdl11enc.t

	- added ::Encoding::nil()

	- test for ::Encoding::struct();

version 0.62: Mon Nov 19 12:55:42 CET 2007

	Changes:

	- XML::Compile::SOAP::HTTPClient renamed into
	  XML::Compile::Transport::SOAPHTTP.
	  It is reworked to extend the new XML::Compile::Transport.
	  Change invisible to WSDL users, but very visible to people
	  who create their own messages.  Some of the trace records
	  changed name as well.

	- swapped arguments of ::Encoding::typed() from
	   (name, type, value) to (type, name, value);

	- WSDL11(::Operation)::prepareClient() renamed into
	  ::compileClient()

	Improvements:

	- moved README.todo text to XML::Compile::SOAP man-page,
	  because people often use pre-packaged modules and therefore
	  may not see the README files.

	- extended the documentation a lot.

	- implemented XML::Compile::SOAP::compileClient(), which was
	  documented but not present.

	- added transport base class XML::Compile::Transport.

	- compileMessage() accepts pre-compiled READER and WRITERs,
	  not only element types.

	- implemented (and documented/tested) literal and encoded RPC.

	- added Encoding::encAddNamespaces()

	- added Encoding::struct()

	- use fake_server to t/wsdl11.t

	Changes:
